## Overview 

The Exolegend Virtual Machine simulates the gameplay environment for **Exolegend #3**, a game where the goal is to color as many grid cells as possible using bombs, while avoiding detonation on the playerâ€™s own position.

This repository contains the necessary files to run the virtual machine and launch the associated game simulation.

## Example Robots:
- [Sentience Beta](https://github.com/Sentience-Robotics/exolegend-beta)


## Prerequisites

- PlatformIO: Ensure that PlatformIO is installed in your environment to compile and run the programs. PlatformIO is used to manage the build and launch of the client.


## Installation & Usage
### 1. Unzip `binaries.zip` 
Unzip the `binaries.zip` file that comes with this repository. The binaries are necessary for launching and running the virtual machine and the game client.
```bash
unzip binaries.zip
```

### 2. Launch virtual machine
Once the binaries are extracted, you can launch the virtual machine with the following command. This will open the web interface of the simulator.
```bash
./launch_virtual.sh
```
Once this script is run, the simulation should be accessible via your web browser.

### 3. Stopping the Virtual Machine
If you need to stop the virtual machine at any time, simply use the following command to kill the process.
```bash
./kill_virtual.sh
```

### 4. Launching Robots
Any robots can be launched using `./ghost.sh` in their directories alongside this server. This script will start the robot's AI and connect it to the virtual machine.

```bash
cd path/to/robot_directory
./ghost.sh
```
